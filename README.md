# JMM
JMM (Javascript Minus Minus) compiles a subset of javascript to WASM.
It's super experimental, so don't use it in production.

## Dependencies
JMM requires node, emscripten, and rust to be installed on your system.

## Rough Roadmap
0.0 "Hello World" compile a simple hello world, basic variables
0.1 "FizzBuzz" add in basic control structures, numbers, and booleans
0.2 "Fibonacci" Basic functions (no closures), recursion
0.3 "Dictionary" Basic objects as HashMaps
0.4 "Scoping" Flesh out scoping rules
0.5 "Closures" 
0.6 "OOP?"
0.7 "DOM" Get DOM APIs
